# Applied Data Science Specialization

This repository contains a project developed as part of the Applied Data Science Specialization. The project utilizes the Foursquare API to analyze and find important venues in a city, such as cuisine-specific restaurants, supermarkets, and other points of interest.

## Project Structure

- **Battle of Neighborhoods**: Contains notebooks and data related to analyzing and comparing different neighborhoods.
- **Battle of Neighbourhoods Part 1**: An in-depth analysis of specific neighborhoods using clustering techniques.
- **Analysis of Week 3.ipynb**: A notebook with analysis and findings for Week 3 of the specialization.
- **Canada.csv**: A dataset containing geographical and demographic data for Canada.
- **Segmentation and Clustering Of Neighbourhoods in Toronto**: A notebook focused on clustering neighborhoods in Toronto based on venue data.
- **Segmentation and clustering of Toronto Part 2**: Continuation of the clustering analysis for Toronto neighborhoods.
- **Toronto-2.ipynb**: Another notebook focusing on Toronto neighborhood segmentation and venue analysis.
- **Week 1.ipynb**: The initial notebook for the capstone project, introducing the problem and approach.
- **Week301** and **Week302**: Additional notebooks for the specialization, containing code and analysis.

## Key Features

- **Foursquare API Integration**: The project integrates with the Foursquare API to retrieve data on venues in specific cities or neighborhoods.
- **Clustering Analysis**: Uses clustering algorithms to segment neighborhoods based on the types and concentrations of venues available.
- **Geospatial Data Analysis**: Analyzes and visualizes the geographical distribution of various types of venues within cities.
- **Neighborhood Comparison**: Compares neighborhoods based on the availability of specific venue types, such as restaurants or supermarkets.
